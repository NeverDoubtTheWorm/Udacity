# wiki_generator_live
live code

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGU5kIG7b2I) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree with Udacity. We're going to code an LSTM in Tensorflow to generate Wikipedia articles. 

## Dependencies

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html) 

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies 

## Basic Usage

I downloaded the data from https://metamind.io/research/the-wikitext-long-term-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/.

Run the notebook with `jupyter notebook` in command line when in the top level directory.

## Credits 

The credits for the original codebase go to [kumikokashii](https://github.com/kumikokashii/lstm-text-generator). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started
